   This dataset shows the location of all the hospitals in Pittsburgh, and we use it to find which neighborhood has the most hospitals.

2. Firearm Seizures: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pbp-fire-arm-seizures/resource/e967381d-d7e9-48e3-a2a2-39262f7fa5c4

   This dataset shows the location of all the firearms in Pittsburgh, and we use it to find which neighborhood has the most firearms.

3. Total Population: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pittsburgh-american-community-survey-2015-miscellaneous-data/resource/82f29015-6905-4b1c-8300-afe9bb2231b3

   This dataset shows the population information of each neighborhood in Pittsburgh, and we use it to find which neighborhood has the least people.

Overview:

Our project was to determine the best Pittsburgh neighborhood to be in to survive the downfall of civilization after a virus has wiped out humanity and we think more hospital resources, more firearm resources, and less people are important to be survived.
